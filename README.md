# Nicum-Question-Tool
Named after the honorary Nicum sir, this tool allows you to have a Question Attempting UI for question papers whose PDFs or Printouts you may have.

The question papers from Telegram and elsewhere, often it is difficult to get a computer based UI to attempt these exams. Fear not, this tool helps. 

Note : A lot of features will be added from 27May2024, onwards so if you are patient you're in for a treat.

If you have ideas to collaborate (and the talent) or just ideas, mail at aritroshome.development@gmail.com
